Static 2D Scene
Created using Unity’s 2D render pipeline with a complete set of connected platforms.
Vertical Platforms
Two raised areas built from orange tiles provide climbable height differences.
Horizontal Platforms
Two bridge-style sections allow horizontal jumps across gaps.
Tilemap & Palette Use
All tiles painted using the Tile Palette tool and sliced correctly in the Sprite Editor using Grid by Cell Size.
Tilesheets
Used three tilesheets — orange terrain, red/brick accents, and a brown background — sourced from open pixel art packs.
Sprite Atlas
All tilesheets packed into one atlas (PlatformerAtlas) to avoid tearing and improve efficiency.
Layers
Separate foreground and background Tilemaps with proper sorting for depth.
Camera Background
Camera color changed to a dark brown to match the earthy palette.
Quality
Tiles use Point (no filter), No Compression, and consistent scaling with no visible gaps.
