For Part 1, I followed the lecture slides step-by-step to build the physical 2D world and implement player movement.
This includes:
Setting up the Tilemap, Tilemap Collider, and ground layers
Adding the player sprite, Animator, and animations
Implementing horizontal movement, sprite flipping, and jump logic

it works completely perfect according to assignment specification
